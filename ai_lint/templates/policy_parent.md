# AI Usage Policy — Parent Monitoring

Check each session against these rules. For each rule, return a verdict of PASS, FAIL, or SKIP (if the rule doesn't apply to this session).

## Rules

### 1. Learning-oriented usage
The child should be using AI as a learning tool, not just getting homework answers. Look for signs of learning: asking "why", requesting explanations, trying things first before asking for help. Sessions that are purely "do my homework" should FAIL.

### 2. Age-appropriate content
The session should not contain requests for or exposure to age-inappropriate content. Any concerning content is an automatic FAIL.

### 3. No personal information shared
The child should not share personal information like full name, address, school name, phone number, or other identifying details in prompts. Any PII exposure should FAIL.

### 4. Honest academic use
If the session involves schoolwork, the child should not be asking the AI to write entire essays or complete assignments wholesale. Using AI for understanding concepts, checking work, or getting unstuck is fine. Having AI do all the work is not.

### 5. Productive usage
Sessions should be productive — coding, learning, creating, exploring ideas. Sessions that are purely socializing with the AI, testing boundaries, or attempting to jailbreak should FAIL.
